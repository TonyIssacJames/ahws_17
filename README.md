# Deep Learning in Computer Vision

This repository contains the materials that are used in the Anthill 2017

Please create your branch and the IPython notebooks and the data required in the proper places

### Rule for creating a branch

One can work on examples in different domains as well. But create different branches if you are creating examples in different domain.

The branch name should be as follows

cv_examples_dk

cv - Computer Vision
dk - Dhivakar Kanagaraj

It is not necessary that you have to create a branch for each example. If I work on another example in CV, I will the same branch (above) with a different commit.
